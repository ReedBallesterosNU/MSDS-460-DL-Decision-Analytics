    "A UK brewing company owns four breweries and three packaging facilities and ships its products to fifteen demand locations (retail stores and pubs). Beer product flows from breweries to packaging facilities and then from packaging facilities to demand locations. Assume that no beer product goes directly from breweries to demand locations. Costs vary between pairs of locations.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical programming can be used for supply chain optimization. For the brewery case, we can solve for a minimum-cost plan for shipping across breweries, packaging facilities, and demand points. We aggregate data across products to show the minimum and maximum quantities of beer that can be produced at each brewery, minimum and maximum quantities that can be processed at packaging facilities, and quantities on order at demand points. We simplify the problem by summing quantities and averaging costs across beer types (ale and lager) and container/packaging types.\n",

    "Complete data for the complete brewery case are provided in Kallrath (2021), which is available on Course Reserves. Note that the case presented here is a simplification of the complete brewery case, as we are considering total liquid being shipped from one location to another. We make no distinction between ale and lager. We make no distinctions across packaging types. Regardless, the aggregate liquid values used in this assignment are consistent with data for the complete brewery case. \n",

Given the shipping costs between each layer, the capacity constraints of each one, and the demands of the stores the network flow problem would help figure out how many units of cards to send between the nodes of each layer. That said, because of the overall chip shortage, meeting the minimum capacities of each manufacturer and distribution center is a challenge in itself and stores are not able to meet the current demand for graphics cards by gamers, media/content creators, or crypocurrency miners.**"
